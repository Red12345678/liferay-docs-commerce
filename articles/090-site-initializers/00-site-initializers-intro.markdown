# Site Initializers

A site initializer is a type of site template that does much of the work of
setting up a store. A site initializer is a convenient sandbox for gaining
familiarity with @commerce@ but it can also be a head start on setting up a live
site.

Typically, a site initializer gives you a theme, a set of customer-facing pages
with a working interface, and a sample catalog.

## Initializing a Site

To set up a site using an initializer, follow these steps:

1.  Go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Sites* &rarr; *Sites*.

2.  Click the ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button select a site initializer
    such as *Beryl* (subscribers only) or *Breccia*.

3.  Enter a name for your store and click *Submit*.

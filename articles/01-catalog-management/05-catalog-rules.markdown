# Catalog Rules

Catalog Rules are a tool for managing the catalog's visibility. They work with
[user segments](web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/7-1/user-segmentation),
to restrict specified buyers so that they can only see a limited portion of the
catalog. This can help focus the attention of a customer who---for instance---is
only authorized to purchase products associated with a particular support plan,
or who wants the convenience of only seeing parts and accessories for equipment
that he already owns.

Follow these steps:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog Rules* and click on the
    ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button.

2.  Give the rule a *Name*, check the box next to *Active*, and select
    *Categories* from the *Type* drop-down box.

3.  Click on the *Select* button that appears and click on as many categories as
    you want specified users to be able to see. Click *Done*.

4.  Click *Save*. A new tab, *User Segments*, appears at the top of the page.

5.  Click on *User Segments* and then click the
    ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button, and select whichever segment or
    segments you want to be limited to the selected categories. Click *Add*.

**Note:** In step 2 above, the only type of rule available specifies a section
of the catalog by category. With the development of additional code, it is
possible to add other custom types, allowing sections of the catalog to be
selected by individual product, by specification, or by any other criterion.
Documentation on this process will be available in the near future.
